# Digital Aquarium Implementation Summary

## 📋 Plan Overview

I've created a comprehensive implementation plan for the Digital Aquarium desktop application. Here are the key highlights:

### 🎯 Project Scope
- **Desktop application** using Electron that visualizes computer activity as a virtual aquarium
- **Fish represent different apps/activities**, aquarium health reflects work-life balance
- **Donationware model** - free to use with optional donations
- **Privacy-first** - all data stays local

### 🛠 Technology Stack
- **Electron** - Desktop framework
- **React + TypeScript** - UI development
- **Three.js + React Three Fiber** - 3D rendering
- **Vite** - Build tooling
- **Material UI + Tailwind CSS** - Styling [[memory:5478181]]
- **Vitest** - Testing framework [[memory:5478198]]
- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD

### 📁 Repository Structure
```

├── .cursor-plans/      # Implementation documentation
├── .ai-context/        # AI context and architecture docs
├── src/
│   ├── main/          # Electron main process
│   ├── renderer/      # React app (UI)
│   ├── shared/        # Shared code
│   └── preload/       # Security bridge
├── tests/             # All test files
└── [config files]     # Build, lint, test configs
```

### 🔒 Key Principles
1. **FAIL HARD Policy** - No silent failures, all errors throw exceptions
2. **Separation of Concerns** - Clear boundaries between processes and modules
3. **Test-Driven Development** - >80% coverage required before proceeding
4. **Popular Packages Only** - Use well-maintained dependencies
5. **Security First** - Context isolation, no node integration in renderer

### 📊 Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- Repository setup with Git
- Core dependencies installation
- Build configuration (Vite, TypeScript, ESLint)
- Basic Electron shell

#### Phase 2: Core App (Week 2-3)
- React application structure
- Three.js scene setup
- Basic aquarium rendering
- Component architecture

#### Phase 3: Features (Week 4-5)
- Activity monitoring system
- Fish spawning logic
- Work-life balance calculations
- Aquarium health visualization

#### Phase 4: Polish (Week 6)
- Comprehensive testing
- CI/CD pipeline
- Documentation
- Release preparation

### ✅ Success Criteria
- Electron app launches successfully
- 3D aquarium renders with WebGL
- Activity monitoring captures app usage
- All tests pass with >80% coverage
- GitHub CI reports green
- Builds for macOS, Windows, Linux

### 🚨 Risk Mitigation
- **Performance**: Early profiling, instanced rendering for many fish
- **Privacy**: Clear data handling, local-only storage
- **Cross-platform**: Test all platforms in CI
- **Dependencies**: Automated security updates

### 🔄 Next Steps
1. **Review this plan** - Any adjustments needed?
2. **Initialize repository** - Set up Git and GitHub
3. **Begin implementation** - Follow the structured phases
4. **Track progress** - Use todo management throughout

## 🤔 Review Questions

Before we proceed with implementation:

1. Does the technology stack align with your vision?
2. Is the 6-week timeline reasonable?
3. Any specific features or concerns to address?
4. Should we adjust the activity monitoring approach?
5. Any preferences for the CI/CD setup?
