# Digital Aquarium Project Status

## Overview
The Digital Aquarium desktop application has been successfully set up with a modern tech stack and is ready for feature development.

## Completed Setup

### ✅ Repository Structure
- Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore
- GitHub repository created at [PrecisionNutrition/digital-aquarium](https://github.com/PrecisionNutrition/digital-aquarium)
- Comprehensive project documentation in place

### ✅ Technology Stack
- **Electron** - Desktop application framework
- **React 18** with TypeScript - UI development
- **Vite** - Fast build tooling
- **Material UI + Tailwind CSS** - Styling framework
- **2D Canvas** - Aquarium rendering (instead of Three.js as per user preference)
- **Vitest** - Testing framework with high coverage requirements

### ✅ Core Features Implemented
1. **Electron Main Process**
   - Security best practices implemented
   - IPC handlers for system info and activity data
   - Window management for macOS and other platforms

2. **React Application**
   - Material UI theme configuration
   - Responsive layout with AppBar
   - Component structure established

3. **2D Aquarium Rendering**
   - Canvas-based aquarium visualization
   - Fish physics and movement system
   - Water effects and background elements
   - Work-life balance indicator

4. **UI Components**
   - **AquariumCanvas** - Main aquarium visualization
   - **StatsPanel** - Displays aquarium metrics
   - **ActivityFeed** - Shows recent computer activities
   - Custom hooks for state management

### ✅ Testing Infrastructure
- Vitest configured with coverage thresholds (50% minimum)
- Unit tests for core components
- Canvas API mocked for testing
- All tests passing

### ✅ CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions configured for macOS
- Automated testing on Node.js 18.x and 20.x
- Code quality checks (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript)
- CI pipeline is green and passing

## Next Steps for Development

### 1. Activity Monitoring System
- Implement actual computer activity tracking
- Create activity categorization logic
- Privacy-first local data storage

### 2. Fish Spawning System
- Map activities to fish types
- Implement fish spawning based on app usage
- Create variety of fish behaviors

### 3. Work-Life Balance Calculations
- Implement metrics calculation
- Create balance scoring algorithm
- Visual feedback in aquarium health

### 4. Persistence Layer
- Local storage for aquarium state
- User preferences
- Activity history

### 5. Enhanced Visuals
- More fish varieties and behaviors
- Particle effects for bubbles
- Day/night cycle
- Aquarium decorations

### 6. User Interface Enhancements
- Settings panel
- Activity filtering
- Statistics dashboard
- Donation integration

## Known Issues
- GitHub Dependabot has identified 1 moderate vulnerability (can be addressed separately)
- Some warnings about TypeScript version compatibility with ESLint (non-critical)

## Development Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Run development server
yarn dev

# Run tests
yarn test

# Run tests with coverage
yarn test:coverage

# Build for production
yarn build

# Run linting
yarn lint

# Format code
yarn format
```

## Architecture Decisions
1. **2D over 3D**: Chose 2D Canvas for simplicity and performance
2. **Local-only data**: Privacy-first approach, no cloud sync
3. **Electron security**: Context isolation, no node integration in renderer
4. **Test coverage**: Set at 50% minimum to allow for iterative development
5. **Donationware model**: No authentication or payment processing required

This foundation provides a solid base for building out the full Digital Aquarium experience.
